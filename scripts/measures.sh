SYNOPSIS
    measures.sh [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
    This script compiles and runs the C program in the src/ directory to measure
    its execution time taking into account different values of the following
    parameters:
        - Array size
        - Compiling optimization level
        - Number of threads used.
    Each combination is tried out multiple times; when all measures are done,
    the 'evaluate.py' script is launched to estimate means and draw tables and
    plots of the newly generated results.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Show this guide and exit.

    -n N, --num-measures N
        Run every measure N times. (default is 100)

    -d DIR, --dir DIR
        Write all the output in the DIR directory of your choice instead of the
        default location './output/'.

    --no-plot
        Do not run the Python script to create the plots and tables." | more -d
